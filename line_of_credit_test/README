CreditLine.rb contains a CreditLine class that represents lines of credit.

CreditLineServer.rb is a server that maintains a collection of all credit lines. It runs on port 7777.

CreditLineClient.rb is a client that communicates with the CreditLineServer. It can be used to create new credit lines,
withdraw/make payments on them, update interest values, and bill the lines.

Two rake tasks are defined in the Rakefile. update_interest updates interest on all credit lines, and should be called daily.
bill bills all credit lines, and should be called once per billing period.


Two cron jobs should be set up: 1 daily job to call 'rake update_interest', and one job that runs every 30 days and  
calls 'rake bill'.
